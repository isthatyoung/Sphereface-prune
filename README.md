## Prune
We adopt a **greedy algorithm** based **channel selection** methods to choose the weak channels in every layer of convolutional neural network and prune them.   
Channel selection follows the key criterion of convolutional neural network  
· The output of *i* layer is the input of *i*+1 layer.  
· The input channels of *i*+1-th layer have one-to-one correspondence with the filters in *i*-th layer.  
· If a set of filters in *i* layer are removed without affecting the output of *i*+1 layer, that means that this set of filters could be safely removed.

### Fine-tuning
1 epoch fine-tuning after pruning every layer. Becuase CASIA Webface contains 452,723 face images, so 1 epoch means 1768 times iteration by setting batch size to 256. Basic leaning rate is set to 1 × 10−3.  
After all layers are pruned, do 8 to 9 epochs fine-tuning, basic learning rate is 1 × 10−3.
